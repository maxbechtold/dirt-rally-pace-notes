# dirt-rally-pace-notes

This collects transcriptions of DiRT Rally pace notes, contributions welcome. These notes enable co-op playing where one player drives the car and the other acts as co-driver reading the notes.

My goal is to provide the game's pace notes as accurately as possible (given the manual process of writing the notes from replays) in a concise notation that people can read quickly and adapt to their needs or translate. 

## Understanding pace notes
You should read this [blog entry](http://blog.codemasters.com/dirt/04/co-driver-calls-explained/) by the guy that reads the pace notes in the game.

## System

There doens't seem to be some official notation, but [this one](http://www.automobilemag.com/news/a-beginners-guide-to-rally-pace-notes/) looks thorough to me and can be used to understand the following (simplified) notation.

## Corners
In ascending severity: ``x6, x5, x4, x3, x2, x1, squarex, hpx, acutex`` where ``x`` is either ``l`` or ``r``.

## Note succession
Quick successions of stage characteristics are denoted as either ``:`` (immediate) or ``->`` (into).  
Otherwise, a number is used representing distance in meters: ``60, 80, 100, 130, 150, 200``
